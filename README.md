# IDS 706 - Data Engineering - Week 12 - Real-Time Streaming System with Apache Kafka

## Project Overview

This project is dedicated to generating a real-time data streaming system with Apache Kafka, PostgreSQL, and Streamlite. The data used for this project is synthetic rideshare data produced using the Python library Faker. The data is streamed using Apache Kafka and stored in a PostgreSQL database. Streamlite is used to create a dashboard with metrics and visualizations.

## Relevant Files

### producer.py

Generates the rideshare data.

### consumer.py

Reads the trips from Kafka and stores them in a database.

### dashboard.py

Sets up the dashboard with features such as key performance metrics and visualizations. Metrics include total trips displayed, total revenue generated, average amount a customer pays per trip (average fare), average trip rating, and the number of trip cancellations. Visualizations include a bar chart showing the total revenue generated by each vehicle type, a bar chart showing the number of trips taken based on the different weather conditions, and a pie chart showing the percentage of trips each city accounts for.

### requirements.txt

Contains dependencies for the project.

### docker-compose.yml

Sets up and runs the docker container.

## Dashboard and Analysis

Here is the dashboard:

Based on the metrics in the dashboard, the total revenue generated is a little under $11,000, with an average fare of about $55. The average rating is about 4.2/5. While this isn't a terrible overall rating, it does show that improvements can (and probably should) be made. One way to explore this deeper is to calculate the average rating for each city and see if there are any cities with particularly low ratings. From the bar chart of revenue by vehicle type, we see that luxury vehicles generate the most revenue. This is probably because luxury vehicles charge more than the other vehicle types. SUV is the second highest revenue-generating vehicle type, which may be because the cities of interest are tourist-heavy cities and they have a lot of activities for large crowds.
